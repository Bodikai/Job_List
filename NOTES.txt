TO DO:

  1) DONE Create Git repository
  2) DONE Research TDD
  3) DONE Create barebones Ruby files
  4) DONE Create spec for .add method
  5) DONE Break down requirements into tasks:
      * DONE Create specs for all examples in PDF
      * DONE Jobs with dependencies must be correctly ordered relative to them
      * Return error if job is dependent on itself
      * Return error if resulting joblist (after adding new) has circular dependencies
  6) DONE Think about best data structure for joblist (jobs and dependencies)
  7) DONE Implement revised joblist data structure which stores dependencies
     per job
  8) DONE Update data structure so that dependencies are stored in HASH but order
     is stored in ARRAY

EXTRAS: Not specifically required but would be useful/logical additions

  * Jobs should be prioritised as follows (from high to low):
    * Jobs with the longest dependency chain
    * Jobs with the smallest dependency chain
    * Jobs with no dependencies
    * Jobs with no dependencies should be sorted alphabetically
  * Ignore duplicates unless they have new dependencies
  * Multiple dependencies. e.g. a => b,c (a dependent on b and c). Consider
    storing ARRAY in the hash value.
  * Check that input string is formatted correctly


REMEMBER:

  * To use IRB to test (and maybe even to use)
  * DON'T overcomplicate things. Just do what is required (for now)

EXERCISE NOTES:

  * I need to improve at blocking out work and tackling/testing each chunk
    separately.
