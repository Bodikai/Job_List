TO DO:

  1) DONE Create Git repository
  2) DONE Research TDD
  3) DONE Create barebones Ruby files
  4) DONE Create spec for .add method
  5) DONE Break down requirements into tasks:
      * DONE Create specs for all examples in PDF
      * Jobs with no dependencies should be sorted alphabetically
      * Jobs with dependencies must be correctly ordered relative to them
      * Jobs with no dependencies should be prioritised lower than those with
      * Return error if job is dependent on itself
      * Return error if resulting joblist (after adding new) has circular dependencies
  6) Think about best data structure for joblist (jobs and dependencies)
      * Ignore duplicates unless they have new dependencies
      * Store dependencies per task
  7) Implement revised joblist data structure
  8) 

EXTRAS: Not specifically required but would be useful/logical additions

  1) Multiple dependencies. e.g. a => b,c (a dependent on b and c)
  2) 


REMEMBER:

  * To use IRB to test (and maybe even to use)
